## üß© Contents

### IPNI Advertisement Tools

- `ipni_monitor.py`  
  Continuously monitors new advertisements from a specific IPNI publisher and extracts metadata (CID, multihash count, linkage).

### Random Advertisement Collection

- `random.py`  
  Collects random advertisements from IPNI using the `ipni random` command, saving multihash lists and statistics.

### Gateway Availability Probing

- `create_files.py`  
  Generates test files and publishes them to IPFS to compute their CIDs.
  
- `gateway_availability_check.py`  
  Periodically checks if each CID is reachable from public gateways (e.g., ipfs.io).

### Multihash Comparison and Policy Matching

- `common.py`  
  Identifies multihashes that appear in two or more storage providers.

- `district_deny.py`  
  Checks multihashes against a denylist file in [badbits][https://badbits.dwebops.pub/badbits.deny] format.
